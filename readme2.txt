 BILCLUB
 That provides a social platform for university clubs.
 
 Current status: 
    Partly working...
 
 Not working: 
    The function for displaying club members remains because we did not have time to complete it.
The facility of student councill's permission to create clubis also missing. Manager profile is not present. 
Actually we finished it but could not integrate it to the project.

What remains to be done:
    Integration of manager profile, creating a system for student council and to display member of a certain club.
