## An application that enables Bilkenters to join a club and explore their interests
In the academic life, social clubs have a remarkable role on developing different skills and socialization. Although Bilkenters have numerous amounts of social clubs in Bilkent University, communication between clubs is not enough to organize events. Also, students struggle to join a club if he/she has not joined a club while the orientation. SRS has a function to join clubs however, many people do not aware of that function and, the function is inadequate. Therefore, students do not have enough information about clubs. Furthermore, there is no efficient app to organize people therefore, clubs sent e-mail to club members manually. Some of the student miss the events as a result of lack of information. Therefore, we propose an app that will provide the user with a range of facilities which can create a link between clubs and club members and students who have not joined certain club yet. The students can easily see the upcoming events chronologically in the main page of the app. If the students decide to join the club, they can learn information about the clubs via our application. Managers can communicate with students to organize bigger events together easily.
